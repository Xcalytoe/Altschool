      <h2>Student Biography</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        My name is <b>Cosmas Ezejiofor</b> with student ID
        <b>ALT/SOE/025/1028</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am a Nigerian, and I reside in Lagos.</p>
      <p>
        I signed up with AltSchool Africa to learn about Backend Development.
      </p>
      <h4>Why I Joined the Program</h4>
      <div>
        <pre>
Although I have a background in frontend development, 

I realized that having a solid grasp of backend 

technologies is essential for becoming a well-rounded engineer. 

AltSchoolâ€™s hands-on, project-based approach and its focus on real-world 

skills made it the perfect choice for me. 

I was particularly drawn to the collaborative learning environment, 

mentorship opportunities, and the practical curriculum that goes beyond theory.
